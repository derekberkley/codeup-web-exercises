    <li class="codeup quote" id="first-quote">“Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way.”</li>
    <li class="codeup quote" id="second-quote">“Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject. So you know you are getting the best possible information.”</li>
    <li class="codeup quote" id="third-quote">“Now, you may look around and see two groups here. White-collar, blue-collar. But I don’t see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.”</li>
    <li class="codeup quote" id="fourth-quote">“There’s no such thing as an appropriate joke. That’s why it’s called a joke.”</li>
